# Analysator
This project helps to collect load profiles of heating energy systems in Germany and analyse them. 
It is developed with Python 3.6.2 using Anaconda3. It is an update of Heating-Analisation.
This application requires a google account including google drive. 


The main function use the function downloader to search for downloadable elements of a homepage. 
Then it scrapes for download links in a second step. After it, it downloads the link chose.
In a third step the main function uses the function Analyser to analyse the data and generates a plot of the selected data.
After that the Analyser uploads the data to google Drive using an API client. The google upload bases on the module of
google_drive_util.py on github:https://gist.github.com/lheric/876a924c5d77bde0f62526c7fa6ad846 .
For using the API client the user has to generate the 'client_secrets.json' from https://console.developers.google.com/ . 

The code of the main function is only rudimental. In further steps a GUI will be provided. 
So, the user can enter a homepage of his choice and can choose more than one download link.
After that he can choose the columns for the data-analysis and which data he wants to plot.
He can edit the plot and save the edited plot.
But this will be in a further step.
