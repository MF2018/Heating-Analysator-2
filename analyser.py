"""This class analyses an excel-file.
It has 7 methods:
1) read reads an excel-file. 
2) getSheets returns all sheets of an excel file.
3) saveExcel writes the analysed data in an excel file.
4) addSheet adds a sheet to an existing excel file.
5) analyse analyses the document, plots the data, save it and uploads the file to google drive.
6) plotDate plots a selected Data column and adds it to excel. In a further step a nominal 
   distribution will be added.
7) googleupload uploads the document to google drive.

It has one global variable error which reinitializes at every call with 0 
Every error value except 0 means an error.
